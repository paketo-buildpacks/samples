# Zero Configuration Static File App
This directory has all of the components for a sample of a zero
configuration static file app that is configurable with either HTTPD or NGINX
web servers.

Specific examples have been split into two seperate files.
- For the HTTPD examples, go to the [`HTTPD.md`](HTTPD.md) file.
- For the NGINX examples, go to the [`NGINX.md`](NGINX.md) file.
