          # 1st step: we get the list of files changed between the tip of this PR branch and main
          # Since we're only interested in the folders containing those files, we get them, sort them alphabetically (`sort`), de duplicate them (`uniq`) and filter out dot folders (.github for example)

          # eventually, we'll find a `smoke_test` folder and add it to `smoke_test_folders`; if not, we move on to the next changed_java_folders entry (until the `.` folder in which case we give up)
